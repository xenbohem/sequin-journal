create a sequined covered, private-book-journal - the front of the sequins are violet and purple gradient and the back of the sequins are cerulean-indigo.  Whatever the user writes, saves in the book. there are 1000 max pages, it is a journal that is digital private and not public unless the user makes it public. Private is the default for the user.  The inspiration for this is a template of a lock diary. So create something that looks like a lock that can be opened when clicked on by the user. So it must be private only for the user.
